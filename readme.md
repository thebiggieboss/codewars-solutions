# Project: Codewars Problem Solutions with Jest

Hello! This project is a collection of my solutions to Codewars problems. I use the Jest library to write and run tests for these problems. This allows me to verify the correctness of my solutions and ensure they meet the expected results.

## Installation and Setup


To install and set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thebiggieboss/codewars-solutions.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: 
    ```bash
    cd codewars-solutions 

3. Install the dependencies, including Jest: 
    ```bash
    npm install -D jest

## Usage

In this project, I provide examples of problem solutions from Codewars. You can use them as reference material or explore different approaches to solving the problems.

To run the tests and see the results, use the following command:

```bash
npm test 'your js file'
```
The test execution results will be displayed in your console, indicating which tests passed and which ones failed.
